# Recipes
This project will showcase my foundational understanding of HTML. It will also demonstrate best practices for writing commit messages with Git.

This website consists of a main index page which contains links to other web pages containing recipes. 

I hope to revisit this project in the future once I have learned CSS and JS to make it visually appealing and have greater functionality.
