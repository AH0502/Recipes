# Recipes

## Overview 
This project will showcase my foundational understanding of HTML. It will also demonstrate best practices for writing commit messages with Git.
## Tech Stack
-HTML
-Git

## Structure 
This website consists of a main index page which contains links to other web pages containing recipes. 

## Roadmap 
I hope to revisit this project in the future once I have learned CSS and JS to make it visually appealing and have greater functionality. 
It would be really cool to add some functionality where people could craete accounts and upload recipes.
